# _A Language Database_

#### _The Capstone Project for Epicodus_

#### By _Anita Kemp_

## Description
This application prompts a user to watch a video and summarize what happened. A researcher can then see a list of summaries and query by word, phrase, or letter, in order to find language patterns. 

# Stretch Goals:
* _Authentication_
* _POS tagging_
* _API call_
* _Voice recording_

## User Stories

_As a researcher_:
    - I want the user to input summary based on a video (for now, to control variability)
    - I want the user to input language background 
    - I want the ability to query user input that has been stored in an API

_As a user_:
    - Users should be able to summarize what happened in video...
